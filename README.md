# Getting Started
Simply import the DynamicTable file into your project and customize to your needs, all the basic functionality is there with no styling.

Features:
- Dynamic variable count, the table will adjust per input data
- Date Parsing built-in the data cell rendering. Typescript Date objects will be able to render itself as strings. (This is not locale by default)


Known issues and workarounds:
- Can't render values that are objects, it currently completely ignores both header and value of object type values
